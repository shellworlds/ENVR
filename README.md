# SLK8 Problem Solution: Support of Q/Z Module

## Problem Statement
Let Z be the ring of integers, Q the rational numbers, and set M := Q/Z. 
Find the support Supp(M), and show that it's not Zariski closed.

## Project Structure
Multi-language implementation demonstrating:
1. Mathematical computation of Supp(M)
2. Zariski topology analysis
3. Cross-platform deployment
4. Collaborative Git workflow

## Languages & Tools
Python, Shell, React, Node.js, Next.js, Vite, Java, HTML, C++, Go, etc.

## System Requirements
- Linux/Mac/Windows
- Git, Docker (optional)
- Multi-language runtimes
