# SLK8 Project - Public Summary

## Problem
Find Supp(M) for M = ℚ/ℤ and show it's not Zariski closed.

## Solution
Supp(M) = { (p) | p prime }
Not Zariski closed in Spec(ℤ)

## Implementation
- 16+ files across 12+ programming languages
- Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, Go, Rust
- React, Next.js, TypeScript components
- Docker containerization
- Complete test suite

## Access
Main repository: https://github.com/shellworlds/ENVR/tree/ENVR48

## Installation
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shellworlds/ENVR/ENVR48/install_slk8.sh | bash
All implementations confirm:

Support contains primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29

Support size: Infinite (all primes)

Zariski closed: False
