# PROOF OF CONCEPT REPORT: SLK8 Problem Solution

## Project Overview
**Project:** SLK8 - Support Analysis of Module M = ℚ/ℤ  
**Date:** $(date)  
**System:** Lenovo ThinkPad P14s Gen 5 AMD, Ubuntu 24.04 LTS  
**Maintainer:** shellworlds  
**GitHub User:** shellworlds  

## Mathematical Solution
**Problem:** Find Supp(M) for M = ℚ/ℤ and show it's not Zariski closed.

**Solution:**
1. **Support Calculation:** Supp(M) = { (p) | p is prime }
2. **Zariski Analysis:** The support is not Zariski closed in Spec(ℤ)
3. **Proof:** 
   - M_(0) = 0 (torsion disappears at generic point)
   - M_(p) ≠ 0 ∀ prime p (p-torsion survives)
   - In Spec(ℤ), closed sets are finite or whole space
   - Support is infinite but ≠ Spec(ℤ) → not closed
