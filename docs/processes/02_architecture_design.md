# Process 2: Architecture Design & Planning

## Purpose
Design scalable, secure quantum-classical hybrid architecture.

## Steps
1. **System Architecture Design**
   - Design high-level architecture
   - Define component interfaces
   - Plan data flow and storage

2. **Quantum Component Design**
   - Select quantum algorithms
   - Design quantum circuits
   - Plan classical-quantum interface

3. **Security Design**
   - Implement quantum-safe cryptography
   - Design access control
   - Plan data encryption

4. **Scalability Planning**
   - Design for horizontal scaling
   - Plan load balancing
   - Design monitoring systems

## Tools
- Draw.io for architecture diagrams
- PlantUML for sequence diagrams
- AWS/Azure/GCP architecture tools
- Threat modeling tools

## Outputs
1. System Architecture Document
2. Quantum Circuit Designs
3. Security Implementation Plan
4. Scalability Strategy

## Success Criteria
- Architecture supports all requirements
- Security requirements met
- Scalability requirements satisfied
- Performance targets achievable
